#' Graph Inference of Population Heterogeneity.
#'
#' griph identifies cell types in single cell RNA-seq datasets,
#' allowing to control for unwanted sources of variance (e.g. batch/cell cycle)
#' that may confound the cell types.
#'
#' The most important function that combines all the steps of cell type identification
#' from \pkg{griph} is \code{\link{griph_cluster}}. Otherwise refer to the vignette
#' to see what else is available and how to optimize results for your particular
#' dataset.
